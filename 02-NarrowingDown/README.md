 Best 3 ideas are :

Recorded Lectures and upload Videos

The split A/B Model

Live-stream through mobile


We will combine ideas 1 and 2 into one because from storyboard we conclude that with the separation of A / B Model recorded videos are also important. If we want the best kind of education under the hybrid system in a poor school, it cannot be done with just one model. There are conflicts whose solutions are different. For smaller conflicts it is better to combine different models and build a good model.
