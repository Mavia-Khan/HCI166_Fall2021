 Best 3 ideas are :

Recorded Lectures and upload Videos

The split A/B Model

Live-stream through mobile


We will combine ideas 1 and 2 into one because in the news board we conclude that with the division of A / B Model recorded videos are also important. If we want the best kind of education under the poor school hybrid program, it cannot be done with just one model. There are conflicts with their different solutions. For smaller conflicts it is better to combine different models and build a good model.
