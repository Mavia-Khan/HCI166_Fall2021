**10 ideas selected after group discussion**

1.The Differentiated Model

(The students who are at home and in person. It works well to make use of both synchronous and asynchronous communication tools for students at home and in person.)


2. The Multi-Track Model(At the start of the course, students sign up for the virtual track (synchronous remote learning), the online track (asynchronous remote learning), or the face-to-face track. As you teach, you run the virtual and in-person lessons at the same time. Meanwhile, students can access the online modules on their own time)


3. The Split A/B Model

A Group meets Monday and Wednesday

B Group meets Tuesday and Thursday

  Friday is off

4. The Virtual Accommodation Model

Here, you can teach the same lesson you would typically teach but have one student volunteer use the video chat and a single computer to allow students to participate. This person can sit near the teacher during direct instruction. You might still do a flipped video that the students at home watch. However, they might just watch you teach face-to-face. As they move into small groups, you can mute the video conference and let the students at home form a small group. You can then place the assignment on your LMS and have students in those small groups continue to work independently as a virtual group. However, it’s important that you continue to check in on them throughout the process.

5. Independent Project Model

Sometimes your in-person activity simply doesn’t connect with what students can do at home. It might involve a specific lab or a maker project. In these rare moments, you might need to do an independent project. Students can learn the same standards and focus on the same learning targets but they do so in a way that is separate from their classmates.
One alternative is to do an independent project that students can do at home or in-person. For example, you might do a Genius Hour Project:

6.Use links to make your plans interactive

7.Keep The Cameras On

8.Use chat tools for real-time collaboration.

9.Record lectures and upload.

10.Make thinking structured and visible.
