**10 ideas selected after group discussion**

1.The Differentiated Model

(The students who are at home and in person. It works well to make use of both synchronous and asynchronous communication tools for students at home and in person.)
Warm-Up: Students at home and in-person work on a warm-up that you have posted to your learning management system. You can set a timer in-person and online so that students know the time limits. This is often when you take attendance.
Direct instruction: Students at home view a prerecorded “flipped video” by pressing play on the link you share in the video chat. Everyone in the video conference should be on mute. Meanwhile, you press play on the same video for your students in-person. This allows all students to access it together.
Guided practice: Students meet together as a whole class. They can submit their questions on a Google Form and you answer them, in the moment, in front of the computer so that students at home can hear. Or, you can allow students to use a wireless microphone and you can hook up the computer to speaker so that students at home can speak to the whole group class and also hear what the in-person class is saying.
Independent practice: As students move into small groups to practice their learning, the students at home can work collaboratively using the breakout rooms while students in person can meet in small groups. You can add accountability components by having students write in a shared document. At times, you might have student groups that include in-person and at-home students but this is admittedly tricky.
Closure: Every students fills out an online form for a closing activity.

2. The Multi-Track Model(At the start of the course, students sign up for the virtual track (synchronous remote learning), the online track (asynchronous remote learning), or the face-to-face track. As you teach, you run the virtual and in-person lessons at the same time. Meanwhile, students can access the online modules on their own time)

Warm-Up: Students in all three tracks log in to their cohort’s LMS and answer the same discussion question. You have the directions for logging in posted on the video chat for the Virtual Cohort and displayed on the board for the face-to-face group. Meanwhile, students in the Online Cohort post their answers on their own time.
Direct instruction: Students at home in the Virtual Cohort view a pre-recorded “flipped video” by pressing play on the link you share in the video chat. Meanwhile, you teach the same direct instruction in a more interactive way to the face-to-face group. Students in the Online Cohort watch the same flipped video as the Virtual Cohort. However, they simply need to watch and respond by the end of the day.
Guided practice: You vary your guided practice depending on the day. So, you might do guided practice work with your in-person class while students in the Virtual Cohort engage in small group discussions to deepen their understanding of the content. The next day, you can flip it. Members of the Online Cohort have the option of joining the Virtual Cohort if they need additional guided practice.
Independent practice: As students move into small groups to practice their learning, the students at home can work collaboratively using the breakout rooms while students in person can meet in small groups. Students in the Online Cohort can collaborate using asynchronous tools.

3. The Split A/B Model

A Group meets Monday and Wednesday

B Group meets Tuesday and Thursday

Friday is off

4. The Virtual Accommodation Model

Here, you can teach the same lesson you would typically teach but have one student volunteer use the video chat and a single computer to allow students to participate. This person can sit near the teacher during direct instruction. You might still do a flipped video that the students at home watch. However, they might just watch you teach face-to-face. As they move into small groups, you can mute the video conference and let the students at home form a small group. You can then place the assignment on your LMS and have students in those small groups continue to work independently as a virtual group. However, it’s important that you continue to check in on them throughout the process.

5. Independent Project Model

Sometimes your in-person activity simply doesn’t connect with what students can do at home. It might involve a specific lab or a maker project. In these rare moments, you might need to do an independent project. Students can learn the same standards and focus on the same learning targets but they do so in a way that is separate from their classmates.
One alternative is to do an independent project that students can do at home or in-person. For example, you might do a Genius Hour Project:

6.Use links to make your plans interactive

7.Keep The Cameras On

8.Use chat tools for real-time collaboration.

9.Record lectures and upload.

10.Make thinking structured and visible.
