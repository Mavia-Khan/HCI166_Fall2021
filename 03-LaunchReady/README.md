At this stage we developed the low-level fedility prototypes of our concept and conducted user surveys so that our design would comply with all HCI rules. Then we made strings (high fedility prototypes) and made an wizard of oz video . Our wizard of oz video  will show the navigation of our visual interface so there will be no need to create a roaming design.
